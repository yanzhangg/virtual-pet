# Project Proposal: Virtual Pet

My idea for the CPSC 210 personal project is a virtual pet. The project will allow users to choose a pet (either
a cat or dog), take care of the pet through feeding, playing, and dressing the pet. I want to have features where
I can move my pet, 


If in the future, if possible, I will add features that allow you to dress your pet in clothing items


This will be accessible to any user should they wish to create a virtual pet. As I am unable to have my own pet, 
and I am reminiscent of the Tamagotchi days,
I decided to create my own version of the Tamagotchi pet.

## User stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to create a pet (dog or cat)
- As a user, I want to be able to name my pet
- As a user, I want to be able to move my pet around
- As a user, I want to be able to feed my pet
- As a user, I want to be able to see how hungry my pet is
- As a user, I want to be able to play with my pet
- As a user, I want to be able to see how happy my pet it
- As a user, I want to pet my pet
- As a user, I want to be able to create multiple pets (dog or cat)
- As a user, I want to be able to see all pets I have
- As a user, I want to be able to search up my pets by name
