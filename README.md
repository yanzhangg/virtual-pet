# Project Proposal: Virtual Pet

My CPSC 210 personal project idea is to create a virtual pet. This idea was born out of the memories of the 
Tamagotchi digital pets back in the 1990s and early 2000s, so my project is a take on the digital pet character. 
This project will allow users to choose a pet (either a cat or dog), and take care of the pet through feeding and playing 
with their pet. In the future, if possible, I also want to have features where I can move the pet and be able to dress 
the pet in different clothing items, such as a hat or shoes. This app will be accessible to any user who would like to 
create and take care of their own virtual pet.
